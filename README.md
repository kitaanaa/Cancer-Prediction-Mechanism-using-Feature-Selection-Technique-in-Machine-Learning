# Cancer-Prediction-Mechanism-using-Feature-Selection-Technique-in-Machine-Learning
Designed a Cancer Prediction mechanism by implementing a feature selection technique using Simulated Annealing Algorithm. The idea of feature selection is to select only the most relevant and important attributes for the prediction and by performing this the efficiency of the prediction improved the accuracy by 6%. The prediction phase is implemented using Support Vector Machine algorithm 
# About
One important method to improve accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of cancer prediction is feature selection, where only relevant attributes participate in classification
Current features-selection methods normally have high computational-cost or require trial and error to find a suitable parameter
A novel feature selector was built using Simulated Annealing algorithm and Support Vector Machine algorithm is being used as a classifier
